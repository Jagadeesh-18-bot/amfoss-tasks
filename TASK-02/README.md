# TERMINAL CHAOS :
## SUB TASK 1 :

To tackle Task 1, I started by cloning the repository from GitHub to my local environment. After setting up the repository, I needed to locate the `parchment.txt` file. I conducted a thorough search through the directory structure using the `ls` and `cd` commands.

To facilitate this process, I employed the `tree` command, which visually displays the hierarchical structure of files and directories. This command provided a clear overview and allowed me to navigate the directory tree efficiently. As a result, I identified that the `parchment.txt` file was located within the ARRAKIS-DEX ---> EOLIAN CAVES directory. Once I pinpointed the file, I accessed it and retrieved the necessary parchment code.

In this way, I successfully completed Part 1 of Task 2.
## SUB TASK 2 :

To complete sub-task 2 of task 02, I first switched between branches using the `git checkout` command to familiarize myself with branch switching. In this task, the goal was to find the holyspell word by identifying files that contain both the words "good" and "holy." These files, referred to as "herbs," are we need to locate the three herb names.

To locate these files, I used the `grep` command with the following syntax: `grep -rlE "holy.*good|good.*holy"`. This command helped me identify the files containing both "good" and "holy." The herb names (or file names) I found were **MOONBLOOM** and **MISTVEIL**. After identifying the herb names, I proceeded to find the required code and successfully completed that part of the task.

Next, I fought against the boss named Kharnook. I defeated the boss and finished the task successfully. üéâ

## SUB TASK 3 :

After completing sub-task 2, locating the code, and defeating the boss, I proceeded to switch to the `Dark-Realm`. This realm is divided into two distinct parts: `Dark-Realm-1` and `Dark-Realm-2`. To access these realms, I needed to find the **Celestial Veil Amulet code**.

I embarked on this task by exploring the `Eolian Caves`, where I used the `tree` command to navigate the cave's structure and locate the elusive code. Successfully uncovering the `Celestial Veil Amulet code` allowed me to unlock both `Dark-Realm-1` and `Dark-Realm-2`. With the realms now accessible, I retrieved the codes required for the next stages of the mission.

## SUB TASK 4 :

After finishing Sub-Task 4, the next step involves synthesizing the results from all four subtasks. üß© Combine the four distinct codes that were obtained by concatenating them into a single sequence, ensuring the order is correct.

With the combined code string in hand, proceed to decode it. This process will reveal the link to the Godsuite repository, which is crucial for the next phase of the project. üîç

Once you have successfully extracted the Godsuite repository link from the decoded information, use this link to clone the repository to your local machine. This will set up the repository in your environment, enabling you to move forward with the subsequent tasks efficiently. üöÄ

## SUB TASK 5 :
Upon accessing the Godsuite repository, you will find a secret code embedded within the commit history. Begin by thoroughly exploring the commit logs to identify this hidden code. Once you have located the code, use the same decoding technique as applied previously to reveal its contents.
After decoding the code, ensure you save the decoded information carefully. This step is crucial as it may be needed for subsequent tasks or references.
With the secret code successfully uncovered, decoded, and saved, you have effectively overcome the various challenges presented and completed Task 2.
