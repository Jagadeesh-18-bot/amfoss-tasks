## Notes

- **COMPLETED**: Task has been completed successfully.
- **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**: Task is in progress or partially completed.
- **NOT COMPLETED**: Task has not been started or completed yet.
- My primary goal in joining the `AMFOSS club` is to position myself for a successful participation in `Google Summer of Code` **(GSoC)**. `GSoC` is a highly competitive program that offers students the opportunity to work on **open-source projects** under the mentorship of experienced developers, contributing to real-world software while receiving a stipend. By actively engaging with `AMFOSS`, I aim to build my skills, gain valuable experience, and make significant contributions to **open-source projects**. This involvement will not only enhance my technical expertise but also strengthen my application for `GSoC`, aligning my efforts with the club's collaborative and innovative environment.

:rocket: **Happy Coding!**
